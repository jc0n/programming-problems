Count Digits
============

You need to build a string with all of the digits from `0..n` concatenated together. Precompute the amount of memory that must be allocated first, in order to hold the string. Assume single-byte characters (no unicode).

Examples:

```
f(n=0) -> 1   # string: 0
f(n=1) -> 2   # string: 01
f(n=10) -> 12 # string: 012345678910
```

Hint: Write a function to count all of the digits in the numbers 0..n.
